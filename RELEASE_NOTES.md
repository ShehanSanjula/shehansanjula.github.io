# Release Notes: v8.2 - 2026 Stable 🔒

## 🛡️ Security Enhancements
### Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation
- **Strict Header Injection:** Implemented an automated Python script (`.github/scripts/inject_headers.py`) to inject comprehensive CSP meta tags into all HTML files during deployment.
- **Permissive Mode:** Adopted a permissive yet secure CSP strategy (`default-src 'self' https: data:`) to ensure seamless integration of external widgets (Cloudinary, Credly, etc.) while preventing mixed content attacks.
- **Referrer-Policy:** Added `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to enhance user privacy.

### 🤖 CI/CD Automation
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Created a robust deployment pipeline (`security-tags.yml`) that automatically handles security injection and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## ⚡ Performance & Stability
- **Attempted Optimization:** explored "Lazy Loading" and "Critical CSS" techniques.
- **Stability First:** Reverted aggressive performance tweaks to maintain 100% visual integrity and stability of the layout.
